# 100DaysOfCode

This is a repo dedicated to track my progress at learning modern web development and JavaScript frameworks through the #100DaysOfCode challenge.

## Day 1: HTML & HTML5

Began the 'Responsive Web Design' course on 
@freeCodeCamp
 and started with the basic building blocks. 

Also, created a new repo to push my daily code progress on GitHub.

## Day 2: CSS Basics 

Started my day with a 90 question quiz on HTML on 
@w3c.

Later moved on to watching tutorials on CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid Layout by 
@traversymedia.

Feel quite great about how my notes look so far.
