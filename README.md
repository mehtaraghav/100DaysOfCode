# 100DaysOfCode

This is a repo dedicated to track my progress at learning modern web development and JavaScript frameworks through the #100DaysOfCode challenge.

## Day 1: HTML & HTML5

Began the 'Responsive Web Design' course on @freeCodeCamp and started with the basic building blocks. 

Also, created a new repo to push my daily code progress on GitHub.

## Day 2: CSS Basics 

Started my day with a 90 question quiz on HTML on @w3c.

Later moved on to watching tutorials on CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid Layout by @traversymedia.

Feel quite great about how my notes look so far.

## Day 3: Practical Project

Today was exciting! I revised my notes and applied those concepts to build a responsive and clean-coded website in HTML5 & CSS. Tested out my understanding of flexbox to make it work on mobile devices.

Switched from Atom Editor to VScode today.

Also completed building another responsive website using HTML and CSS by following along to @developedbyed's tutorials.
