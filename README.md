# 100DaysOfCode

This is a repo dedicated to track my progress at learning modern web development and JavaScript frameworks through the #100DaysOfCode challenge.

## Day 1: HTML & HTML5

Began the 'Responsive Web Design' course on @freeCodeCamp and started with the basic building blocks. 

Also, created a new repo to push my daily code progress on GitHub.

## Day 2: CSS Basics 

Started my day with a 90 question quiz on HTML on @w3c.

Later moved on to watching tutorials on CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid Layout by @traversymedia.

Feel quite great about how my notes look so far.

## Day 3: Practical Project

Today was exciting! I revised my notes and applied those concepts to build a responsive and clean-coded website in HTML5 & CSS. Tested out my understanding of flexbox to make it work on mobile devices.

## Day 4: Practical project II

Switched from Atom Editor to VScode today.

Also completed building another responsive website using HTML and CSS by following along to @developedbyed's tutorials.

## Day 5: Applied Visual Design

- Finished my web design pratice project by @developedbyed
- Revised my notes
- Completed the chapters on  Visual Design on @freeCodeCamp

## Day 6: Applied Accessibility 

Learned about a11y today and realized how important it is to a significant numbers of users on the web who are overlooked more often than not.

Want to focus on this section well to get my fundamentals right.
